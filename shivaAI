SHIVA AI is a concept for a virtual assistant that uses a combination of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive, interactive user interface.
While the fictional Jarvis was highly advanced, a real-world Jarvis project can serve as a personal assistant to execute
commands, perform actions, or even automate tasks on a computer or within a web application.

Applications & Real World use with benifits:-

Personal Use:
Help with managing daily tasks.
A lightweight assistant for browsing and small automations.

Educational Purpose:
Teach the basics of web development and how JavaScript can interact with user inputs.
Provide an introduction to event handling, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic.

Professional Tools:
Expand to include advanced features like scheduling meetings, fetching business reports, or sending automated emails.

Fun and Creativity:
Add personality traits to Jarvis, making the interactions more engaging and conversational.


How Does it Work
Frontend Technologies:
HTML: Provides the structure for the interface (chat box, buttons, etc.).
CSS: Styles the virtual assistant for a modern and visually appealing design.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for understanding and responding to user inputs.
